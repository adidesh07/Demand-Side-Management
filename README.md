# Cost saving algorithm
###### A cost saving algorithm for potential future use in smart meters.

This is a Matlab project based on the concept of genetic algorithm. 
It yields a reduced cost per day consumption for the consumer by implementing load shifting thereby flattening the load
curve of the grid. Dynamic pricing for consumption is considered.
